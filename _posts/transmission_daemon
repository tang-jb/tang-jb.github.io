For example, if you want to whitelist “192.168.0.123“, you would use the following.

    "rpc-whitelist": "127.0.0.1,192.168.0.123",

sudo systemctl reload transmission-daemon





10. If you are using Transmission, you will likely want it to start up in the background automatically.

The first thing we need to do is create a new user called “transmission“. You will need to ensure the directories you want to save your torrents to can be accessed by this user.

sudo adduser --system --group transmission
